Algorithm: 

CalculateTop100.java - 

Mapper processes each line of input and tokenizes it into individual words. Each word is then checked to see if it contains only ASCII characters. Each word then emits as a key-value pair with value 1. 

Reducer calculates sum of values for words that are the same. The results of word and sum of value (count) of Top100 words based on count are stored in a TreeMap 



CalculateRelativeFrequency.java - 

Store word pairs from "Top100" file, break up input.txt into words, check if words A and B are present in input.txt, keep count of cooccurrences, sort based on relative frequency, print top100 word pairs with relative frequencies
